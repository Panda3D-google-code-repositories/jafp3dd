a bud:
    is a nodepath
    has a position, wrt parent (use branch nodes initially)
    has a attachLeaf method
        creates/loads a leafModel and texture 
        attaches a leaf model to this nodepath
    has a attachBranch method
        creates a branch
        creates branch geom
        attaches branch geom to this nodePath

a branch:
    is a geometry node (to be attached to a bud)
    has a total length
    has a root/base radius
    has a heading, wrt parent bud (using the "tree" angle Func (in main loop initially)
    has a collection of nodes defining geometry (including the root/base)
        a node radius function (with kwargs input)
        a node length/pos func (kwargs)
    has a list of buds(children):
        
a branchNode has:
    the node position (spatial coordinates)
    the texture UV coordinates
    the node distance along the branch (kind of a hack to keep in here)
    the node radius
    a circumference vertex func including noise
    
a tree is: (may need to be no more than a list of buds attached to a parent nodepath)
    a collection of "buds" (with their associated child branches and buds)
