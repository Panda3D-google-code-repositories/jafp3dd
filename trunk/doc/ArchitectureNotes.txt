    redefining the tiling structure. 
    A class TILE will now be
        subclass of NodePath
        One HM with NxM texture maps offset on the HM appropriately
            HM will be generated once and updated as LOD mesh        
            texture maps will be loaded in background
        A list of static objects
            the list can be updated for changes in things like tree states, resources etc
            updates will come from the server (mostly)
            
        A list of NPCs on the tile
            NPC's can be added,transfered to another tile, or deleted
            *** THIS IMPLIES COMM's BETWEEN TILES?

# I think this amounts to the following work
        Create the class TILE()
        TILE() is a munge of terrainManager, objectManager, and a non existent
            NPC manager
        ** a TILE is a chunk of map that is "in scope" for rendering and updating
        for the client ***

        *** TILEs on the server side will naturally fit into parallel processes
                tiles on server side need to interact, client side is only receiver of 
                state of tile on server side
