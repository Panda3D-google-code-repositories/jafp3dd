01/17/2012 Been skipping this too much! The state of affairs: 
	-Terrain manager can load multiple tiles of terrain. 
	-Simple NPCs exist and move around on the tiles. 
	-implemented a queue for object(NPC) movements to later enabled sync'ing pos with server (interpolate from passed position data)
	-Improving modeling in Blender. MrStix is becoming my low poly avatar
	-started some work on procedural control of a model's joints (for the combat system). 
	-Some basic client and server classes created. 
	-The main object is now a NetClient subclass as well as a Showbase.
	-implemented a "map" file so the Client can just be told to load map "nnnn"
