Transforms:
APPLY BEFORE EXPORT! (or write import code to apply it...easier upfront!)

Textures:
    USE UV MAPS TO WORK.

OBSTACLES: 
(base panda collision nodes)
    DEFINE walls, triggers, etc using Blender Game Properties
    typically make property: Collide with value Polyset descend keep (see egg syntax for full options)

(using bullet panda)
	static Rigid objects: import complex as primitives, convexhull, or triangleMeshShape. if visible, reparent to render tree
		test for visible using blender game property -> a node tag. Test tag value/existence

	dynamic Rigid objects: make sure to reparent the visible model to the RigidbodyNode

Animations:
    REMEMBER to add the animation to the armature list before exporting
